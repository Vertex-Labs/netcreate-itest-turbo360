## Documentation Index

This folder contains our **in-progress documentation and working logs.** It's archived with the repo itself so contributors on the project can follow the thinking that goes into the design of various application features.

Because these are *WORKING* documents, they may not always be up-to-date with the current system. We will try to keep these docs annotated as we discover what is out-of-date, and mark which documents can be considered canonical.
