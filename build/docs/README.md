## Documentation Index

This folder contains our in-progress documentation and developer logs. It's archived with the repo itself so contributors on the project can follow the thinking that goes into the design of various application features.

Because these are *WORKING* documents, they may not always be up-to-date with the current system. We will try to keep these docs annotated as we discover what is out-of-date, and mark which documents can be considered canonical.
