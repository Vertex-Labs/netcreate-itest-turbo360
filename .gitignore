# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring
# files.

# If you find yourself ignoring temp files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore

# NetCreate ignored directories
/runtime
netcreate-config.js

# ignore assets/data?
# not sure why this data is in the repo
# /app/assets/data

# Also ignore build system directories
.npmignore
/public
/node_modules

# And don't commit personal log files or temp
*_log.md
*.log
/tmp*

# And don't commit .zip archives either
*.zip

# Ignore all generated files
npm-debug.log
*.tmproj

# Numerous always-ignore extensions
*~
*.diff
*.patch
*.err
*.orig
*.log

# Ignore OS or Editor folders
.DS_Store
.cache
.project
.settings
.tmproj
nbproject
Thumbs.db
